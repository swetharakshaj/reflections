What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- When I initialize a repo, a file is created for git metadata to track commits is created
- This is needed if I want version control on that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


Commands:

git diff (diff between working directory and staging area)
git diff --staged (difference between staging area and latest commit in repo)
git diff commit1 commit2 (difference between 2 commits in the repo)
git branch (view branches)
git branch name  (created branch with given name)
git checkout branch-name (will checkout specified branch)
