What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- When I initialize a repo, a file is created for git metadata to track commits is created
- This is needed if I want version control on that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
